# GenericMangoDownloader

Initially only intended for cafe. Kinda expanded on its own and cafe sorta died.

It actually works this time. At least on Python 3.11.2.

Refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/Benjababe/GenericMangoDownloader/wiki) for detailed use.

## Prerequisites

Install required python packages in requirements.txt into your environment. 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
