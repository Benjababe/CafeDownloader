# NotCafeDownloader

Initially only intended for cafe. Kinda expanded on its own

It actually works this time. At least on Python 3.5.4.

Refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/Benjababe/NotCafeDownloader/wiki) for detailed use.

## Prerequisites

Install required python packages in requirements.txt. Be sure to install tkinter separately if you wish to use the GUI app.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
